# js_pac_man
A pac man game written in JS, CSS, and HTML built following along with Ania Kub√≥w's tutorial at:
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeUGlSl2i4Q, styled in homage to the Karl Havoc sketch from I Think You Should Leave.

 The game can be played here: https://agiantbird.github.io/js_pac_man/

 Win by feeding Karl Havoc all the dots and hot dogs without running into a camera.
 
 If you eat a hotdog you can run into a camera and send them back to the crew van for ten seconds.
